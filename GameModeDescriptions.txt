In Decay Mode, all allied drones slowly
lose their health over time. If their
health drops to 0, they will return to
neutral. However, you have one trick up
your sleeve: Shooting your own drones
will heal them!

In Homing Mode, both players are given
one special block that they can shoot.
This block has a lot of health, and only
you can make progress in taking it down,
but upon destruction your bullets gain the
ability to home towards the closest target!

In Setup Mode, each game starts with a
timer. While the timer remains active,
drones will not retaliate and neither
player can damage the other. Once the
timer is up, each player is disabled from
attacking. Who built the strongest army?
